# Foodiefeed

**Foodiefeed** is a project developed as my engineering thesis. It is an application for sharing culinary recipes. This work consists of two projects:
- **Foodiefeed**: the client application, implemented in **.NET MAUI**.
- **Foodiefeed_api**: the application API responsible for the backend.

## Architecture

Foodiefeed is built using the **MVVM pattern**. To run the application, simply download the Foodiefeed project.  
The API has been deployed to **Azure Cloud** and is available as a public endpoint.

## Future Plans

What could I implement in the future? Planned features include:
- **JWT Token Authentication**
- **Real-time chat** for communication using the **SignalR framework**
